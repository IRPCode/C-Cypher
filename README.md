This program takes an input file that is designated in the code, and passes it off to another class that cyphers the code using a simple cyphering algorithm.
The algorithm is based off of a key between the values one and ten that the user enters at the start of the program.

The intention of the program is to show safe C programming practices, and to show a simple application of C.

Here is an example of the program running:

NOTE: The program can properly handle errors that are thrown at it, such as failing to read or write files.
